# B-Kind functional specification

Not for profit app and website that is a platform for people to share random acts of kindness. 
Random acts of kindness can alleviate stress in the world for people. 
It can make a huge difference to people's happiness levels and sometimes restore peoples faith in humanity.
 
The site should be a social media type platform that allows people to create a profile (limited information), 
they would then be able to upload a story. It can be as small or as big as you like. I bought someone a coffee, I helped change a flat tyre or maybe even saved a personï¿½s life.
